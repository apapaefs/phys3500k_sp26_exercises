The sequence of approximations of this form is:$\\frac{1}{1}, \\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{7}{5}, \\frac{17}{12}, \\frac{41}{29}, \\frac{99}{70}, ...$, where the denominator of each fraction is a Pell number, and the numberator is the sum of a Pell number and its predecessor in the sequence. That is, the solutions have the form:\n",
